Description: DNAfusion can identify gene fusions such as EML4-ALK
  based on paired-end sequencing results.
  This package was developed using position deduplicated BAM
  files generated with the AVENIO Oncology Analysis Software. These files are made using
  the AVENIO ctDNA surveillance kit and Illumina Nextseq 500 sequencing. This is a targeted 
  hybridization NGS approach and includes ALK-specific but not EML4-specific probes.
